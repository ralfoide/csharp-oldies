About Yasashii
--------------


Yasashii is a simple Japanese/English two-way dictionnary based on the JMdict data file.
The application is build straightforward .Net/C#. The original goal was to directly search
the XML using XPath. That did work but unfortunately 45 s to load 30 MB XML file made it
inadequate so I reverted to a basic string cache and a brute force search in a memory cache.

Yasashii is free software.
