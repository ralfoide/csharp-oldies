<!-- Rev 1.03 after feedback 
     The most recent major change had been to rename the project 
     "JMdict" and add the g_lang attribute to the <gloss> entity
     - 08 May 1999 
     I have moved the <gram>, <field> and <misc> elements down to be in the
     <sense> region, as suggested by Chris Czeyka. I have also tidied up
     some of the "*" as he suggested.

<!ELEMENT entry (ent_seq, k_ele*, r_ele+, info*, sense+)*>
	<!-- Entries consist of kanji elements, reading elements, 
	general information and sense elements. Each entry must have at 
	least one reading element and one sense element. Others are optional.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ent_seq (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- A unique numeric sequence number for each entry
	-->
<!ELEMENT k_ele (keb, ke_inf*, ke_pri*)>
	<!-- The kanji element, or in its absence, the reading element, is 
	the defining component of each entry.
	The overwhelming majority of entries will have a single kanji
	element associated with a word in Japanese. Where there are 
	multiple kanji elements within an entry, they will be orthographical
	variants of the same word, either using variations in okurigana, or
	alternative and equivalent kanji. Common "mis-spellings" may be 
	included, provided they are associated with appropriate information
	fields. Synonyms are not included; they may be indicated in the
	cross-reference field associated with the sense element.
	-->
<!ELEMENT keb (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element will contain a word or short phrase in Japanese 
	which is written using at least one kanji. The valid characters are
	kanji, kana, related characters such as chouon and kurikaeshi, and
	in exceptional cases, letters from other alphabets.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ke_inf (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This is a coded information field related specifically to the 
	orthography of the keb, and will typically indicate some unusual
	aspect, such as okurigana irregularity.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ke_pri (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This and the equivalent re_pri field are provided to record
	information about the relative priority of the entry, and are for
	use either by applications which want to concentrate on entries of 
	a particular priority, or to generate subset files. The reason
	both the kanji and reading elements are tagged is because on
	occasions a priority is only associated with a particular
	kanji/reading pair.
	-->

<!ELEMENT r_ele (reb, re_restr*, re_inf*, re_pri*)>
	<!-- The reading element typically contains the valid readings
	of the word(s) in the kanji element using modern kanadzukai. 
	Where there are multiple reading elements, they will typically be
	alternative readings of the kanji element. In the absence of a 
	kanji element, i.e. in the case of a word or phrase written
	entirely in kana, these elements will define the entry.
	-->
<!ELEMENT reb (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- this element content is restricted to kana and related
	characters such as chouon and kurikaeshi. Kana usage will be
	consistent between the keb and reb elements; e.g. if the keb
	contains katakana, so too will the reb.
	-->
<!ELEMENT re_restr (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate when the reading only applies
	to a subset of the keb elements in the entry. In its absence, all
	readings apply to all kanji elements. The contents of this element 
	must exactly match those of one of the keb elements.
	-->
<!ELEMENT re_inf (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- General coded information pertaining to the specific reading.

<!ELEMENT bib_tag (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT bib_txt (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- Bibliographic information about the entry. The bib_tag will a 
	coded reference to an entry in an external bibliographic database.
	The bib_txt field may be used for brief (local) descriptions.-->

	of the entry. -->
<!ELEMENT links (link_tag, link_desc, link_uri)>
<!ELEMENT link_tag (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT link_desc (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT link_uri (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- This element holds details of linking information to 
	entries in other electronic repositories. The link_tag will be
	coded to indicate the type of link (text, image, sound), the 
	link_desc will provided a textual label for the link, and the 
	link_uri contains the actual URI.  -->
<!ELEMENT audit (upd_date, upd_detl)>
<!ELEMENT upd_date (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT upd_detl (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT sense (stagk*, stagr*, gram*, xref*, ant*, field*, misc*, gloss*, example*, s_inf*)>
	<!-- The sense element will record the translational equivalent
	of the Japanese word, plus other related information. Where there
	are several distinctly different meanings of the word, multiple
	sense elements will be employed.
	-->
<!ELEMENT stagk (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT stagr (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- These elements, if present, indicate that the sense is restricted
	to the lexeme represented by the keb and/or reb. -->
<!ELEMENT xref (#PCDATA)*>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate a cross-reference to another
	entry with a similar or related meaning or sense. The content of
	this element must exactly match that of a keb or reb element in 
	another entry.
	-->
<!ELEMENT ant (#PCDATA)*>
	<!-- This element is used to indicate another entry which is an
	antonym of the current entry/sense. The content of this element

<!ATTLIST gloss g_lang CDATA #IMPLIED>
	<!-- The g_lang attribute defines the target language of the
	gloss. It will be coded using the two-letter language code from
	the ISO 639 standard. When absent, the value "en" (i.e. English)
	is implied. -->
<!ELEMENT pri (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- These elements highlight particular target-language words which 
	are strongly associated with the Japanese word. The purpose is to 
	establish a set of target-language words can effectively be used as 
	head-words in a reverse target-language/Japanese relationship.
	-->
<!ELEMENT example (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- The example elements provide for pairs of short Japanese and
	target-language phrases or sentences which exemplify the usage of the 
	Japanese head-word and the target-language gloss. Words in example 
	fields would typically not be indexed by a dictionary application.

<!ELEMENT s_inf (#PCDATA)>
	<!-- The sense-information elements provided for additional
